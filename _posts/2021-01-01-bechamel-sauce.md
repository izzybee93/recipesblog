    1. Heat the oil in a pan at medium to high heat. As the oil heats, add the flour and stir or whisk vigorously. Add the nutritional yeast and mix.
    2. Add the soya milk and continue to whisk, and allow the sauce to gradually thicken. The sauce will usually reach the desired thickness after it has boiled then simmered for a few minutes. Keep in mind that the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.
    3. Remove from the heat and add the desired seasoning, such as salt, black pepper and garlic powder.

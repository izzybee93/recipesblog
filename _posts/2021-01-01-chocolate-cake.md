    * 225g self-raising flour
    * 1 tsp bicarbonate soda
    * ½ tsp sea salt
    * 180g caster sugar
    * 30g cocoa powder
    * 15ml fresh squeezed lemon juice
    * 250ml non-dairy milk (oat or soya)

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Spray a cake pan with non-stick spray and line the bottom with parchment paper. Set aside.
 
    2. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the baking soda, salt, cocoa powder and sugar.
    
    3. To make the vegan buttermilk, add the lemon juice to a measuring jug, followed by the milk. Leave it to sit for two minutes - it will curdle into buttermilk.

    4. Add the aquafaba, vegan buttermilk, vanilla, oil, and apple cider vinegar into the mixing bowl and mix in. Mix until there are no large lumps remaining.

    5. Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

    6. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely before frosting.

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a large cake tin with parchment paper, or a muffin tin with 12 muffin cases. Set aside.
    2. To make the vegan buttermilk, add the lemon juice to a measuring jug, followed by the milk and leave it to sit for two minutes.
    3. In a large bowl, add the flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt, cocoa powder and sugar and mix.
    4. In a large measuring jug, add the buttermilk, vanilla, oil, apple cider vinegar and aquafaba and whisk together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Mix until no large lumps remain.
    5. Pour or divide the cake batter into the tin. Bake for 30 minutes. If making muffins, bake for 20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

    1. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the milk, maple syrup, vanilla, flour, flaxseed, and cinnamon.
    2. Heat the frying pan and add a little bit of vegan butter.
    3. Whisk the batter again before dipping bread, as the flour will settle to the bottom of the bowl. Dip each side in the batter and let soak for about 10 seconds, then add the bread to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
    4. Meanwhile, to make the blueberry topping, gently heat the maple syrup and blueberries in a saucepan until the berries start to pop and release their juices. Continue to stir on a low heat until slightly thickened.
    5. Serve the french toast with blueberry topping, fruit and maple syrup.

    1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the starter, water, and olive oil. Add the flour and salt and stir to thoroughly to form a soft and sticky dough. Cover the bowl with a tea-towel and rest for 30 minutes.
    2. Wet your hand with water and perform at least 6 stretch, fold and rotate 90 degrees motions. Then flip the whole mass of dough such that the seams of your folds face down against the bottom of the bowl. At this point, the dough will have become more smooth. Repeat this process 3 more times: Rest the dough for another 30 minutes, then stretch and fold again exactly the same as before. Cover once more and leave to rest for 4 hours at room temperature. Your dough will probably not rise significantly.
    3. Wet your hands and divide the dough evenly into three 240g rounds. Coat the inside of 3 containers with oil and place a dough ball seam-side down into each one. Cover with lids. Refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using. The dough kept in the refrigerator up to 5 days and will continue to develop flavor.
    4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 225Â°C. To make the pizza, gently stretch the dough into a rough circle. Place on a floured piece of parchment paper. Continue to gently flatten and stretch the dough into a thin circle about 25cm. Form a thicker border around the edge for a bubbly crust. Add marinara sauce and desired toppings. Bake for 10-15 minutes. Serve immediately.

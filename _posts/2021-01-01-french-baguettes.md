    1. Mix: In a large bowl, add the flour, salt and yeast and mix. Add the water mix well. Knead in the bowl for 5-10 minutes - the dough will be quite liquid. Cover with a damp tea-towel and leave at room temperature for 20 minutes. 
    2. Fold: Gently transfer the dough to lightly floured surface. Perform a fold: lift and fold the dough three times on itself, trying to trap air inside. Cover and leave for 20 minutes. Repeat this process 2 more times, to make a total of 1 hour. Let the dough rest for 2 hours (or place in the fridge overnight).
    3. Shape: Prepare a large baking tray lined with baking paper. Gently divide the dough into 4 pieces, and shape into ball without releasing too much air. Leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes (or 40 minutes if refrigerated overnight). Slightly flatten the dough and fold in half. Fold it over again and give it a baguette shape (gently to keep the bubbles). Place on the tray, cover and leave to rise for 30 min. Preheat the oven to 220°C.
    4. Slash the top of the baguettes with sharp knife, to determine where the bread will open. Pour a glass of water in the bottom of the oven then bake for about 30 min.

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a loaf tin with baking paper.
    2. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt, and set aside.
    3. In a separate bowl, mash the bananas. Add the sugar, oil, milk and sourdough starter. Stir together until smooth.
    4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet. Stir together until combined but try not to overmix. Add a little more milk as needed.
    5. Pour the batter into the loaf tin. Bake for 50-60 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the loaf comes out clean. If the loaf looks like it's browning too much but is not cooked through yet, cover with foil for the last 20 minutes of baking. Allow to cool before serving.

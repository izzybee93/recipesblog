    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a large baking tray with baking paper.
    2. In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, onion, parsley, coriander, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and olive oil. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.
    3. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Shape the falafel into small patties, about 5cm wide and 2.5cm thick. Place each falafel on the tray and brush with sesame oil.
    4. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, carefully flipping the falafels halfway through baking, until deeply golden on both sides.
    5. Serve with salad, tahini sauce and pitta.

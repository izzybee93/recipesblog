    1. Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once heated, and the onions and peppers. Cook until softened and lightly browned, about 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. 
    2. Add the tomatoes, smoked paprika, sweet paprika and thyme. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes.
    3. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute until coated.
    4. Slowly pour in half of the vegetable stock. Do not stir after this point or it will release starches and cause creamier rice. Turn the heat to medium-high, and bring to a heavy simmer for 1-2 minutes. 
    5. Turn the heat down to a mild simmer, adding the rest of the stock as needed, but do not over-stir. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until rice is al dente.
    6. Gently stir in the peas. You will need to pay close attention to the socarrat forming on the bottom of the pan (the golden rice crust). You will start to hear a snap, crackle, and pop, along with smelling a nutty aroma. This should take 1-2 minutes to form.
    7. Top with fresh parsley, black pepper and side with lemon wedges to serve.

    1. Place the starter, salt, and water in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add the flour and mix again until fully incorporated. Leave for 30 minutes.
    2. Perform one fold: Pull the dough up and fold over. Turn the bowl in quarter turns and continue to pull and fold over 8 to 10 times. Cover and leave at room temperature for 4-8 hours, until doubled in size. In a clean bowl or container, drizzle and coat the dough with oil, then transfer to the fridge for 8-12 hours.
    3. The next morning, line a baking tray. Fold the dough envelope style from top to bottom and side to side to create a rough rectangle. Turn dough over so seam-side is down. Gently scoop the dough into the center of the tray. Brush the top of dough with oil. Leave for 4-6 hours, until puffy and nearly doubled.
    4. Heat the oven to 220ÂºC. Wet your hands, press your fingers gently into the dough to dimple and stretch the dough to nearly fit the pan. Sprinkle generously with sea salt / rosemary / garlic / oregano / tomato / olive / other toppings. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

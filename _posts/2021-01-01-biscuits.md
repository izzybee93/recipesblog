    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line two large baking trays with baking paper.
    2. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together, then add the vanilla extract and mix.
    3. In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until crumbly. Add the milk and mix in until a dough forms, adding more milk if needed.
    5. Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Roll out the dough to around 1cm thick, and cut out the cookies using a cookie cutter, then place on the tray.
    8. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes until golden. Allow to cool on a wire rack before decorating with icing or melted chocolate, or simply enjoy on their own.

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line two baking trays with baking paper.
    
    2. In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy.

    3. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla extract.

    4. In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking powder and salt (if needed), and stir together. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix to combine, using your hands if needed.

    5. Scoop out 1½ tbsp of the dough each time and roll into balls. Place the balls of dough about 5cm apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern.

    6. Bake for 12 – 15 minutes (a longer bake will create a crunchier cookie). Let cool a few minutes, then transfer to wire rack.

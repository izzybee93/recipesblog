    1. In a large bowl, mix together the mashed banana, milk and sugar.
    2. Add the flour, yeast and salt and mix to form a rough dough. Transfer the dough to a surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth and soft.
    3. Transfer back to the bowl and add the butter. Mix into the dough using your hands, then transfer to the surface and continue to knead for 5-10 minutes, until the dough can stretch it to a thin windowpane without it tearing.
    4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and set aside to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. If baking the next day, transfer the dough to the fridge. Ensure to remove the dough from the fridge at least an hour before continuing the next step.
    5. Grease a bundt tin. Mix together the sugar and spices in a wide, shallow bowl. Spoon 2 tbsp of melted butter, 3 tbsp of spiced sugar, and 4 tbsp of chopped nuts into the base of the tin.
    6. Knock back the dough and knead briefly. Tear small pieces of dough off and roll them into small balls, around 50 in total.
    7. Dunk a few dough balls at a time in the melted butter, then roll them in the spiced sugar until fully coated. Place in the tin and repeat until the tin has a full layer of dough in. Scatter over the some remaining nuts, then continue to layer the coated dough balls in the tin.
    8. Cover the tin and leave to rise in a warm place for about an hour. It is ready to bake when the dough is puffy and springs back slowly, leaving a small indentation, if gently poked with a finger. If it springs back quickly and fills in completely then it needs to rise for longer.
    9. When the dough is nearly ready, preheat the oven to 180°C. Bake for 35-45 minutes until nicely browned and crisp on top. A probe thermometer inserted into the centre should reach at least 90°C.
    10. Allow to cool in the tin for about 30 minutes before turning it out onto a serving plate. Best served warm and freshly baked.

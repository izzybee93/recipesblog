    1. Preheat the oven to 170°C.
    2. In a saucepan, add the cooking apples, caster sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest and juice and water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 5 minutes, or until the apples have started to soften. Remove from the heat and mix in the eating apples. Transfer to a baking dish. Let the fruit cool before adding the crumble topping.
    3. In a medium bowl, mix the flour and salt. Add the butter and rub together with your fingertips until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar, then scatter the topping over the fruit, but don’t press down. Sprinkle the topping with oats. If making ahead of time, chill until ready to bake.
    4. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes until the topping is golden and crisp, and the juices are starting to bubble up around the edges.
    5. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place the squash on a tray, covered with 1 tbsp oil and the chopped sage. Roast for 30 mins until soft.

    2. While the squash is roasting, prepare the risotto. Heat the remaining oil in a pan, add the onions and cook gently for 5 mins until soft, followed by the the garlic, stirring occasionally. Stir in the rice until it is shiny and coated.

    3. Pour in the wine and simmer until completely evaporated. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stir over a low heat for 25-30 mins, until the rice is cooked al dente and the risotto is creamy.

    4. When the squash is cooked, separate half into a bowl and purée with a little bit of left over stock or water. When the risotto is just done, stir in the purée, followed by some whole chunks of squash. Serve the risotto scattered with the remaining squash and the crisp sage leaves.

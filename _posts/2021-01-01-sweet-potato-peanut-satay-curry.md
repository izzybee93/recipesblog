    1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Place the sweet potato on a baking tray and toss with oil. Roast for 30 mins, or until soft. 
    
    2. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and fry gently for 7-8 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, chilli flakes, curry powder, tomato puree, peanut butter and a little dash of stock. Give everything a good mix to create a paste, then fry for another minute or so, until the spices release their aromas.
    
    3. Gently add the chunks of roasted sweet potato into the pan along with the rest of the vegetable stock and the chickpeas. Mix well, season generously with salt and pepper, then bring to a simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the sauce slightly.

    4. Stir in the spinach and lime juice. Allow the spinach to wilt before removing the pan from the heat.

    5. Serve over rice or quinoa topped with fresh coriander.

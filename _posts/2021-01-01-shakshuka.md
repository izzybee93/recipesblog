    1. Warm the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the onion for a few minutes, then add garlic, bell pepper, and spices. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are tender and turning translucent, about 4 to 6 minutes.
    
    2. Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 minute.

    3. Pour in the crushed tomatoes with their juices and add the cilantro. Stir, and let the mixture come to a simmer. Reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, stir in the spinach and cook for 5 minutes to give the flavors time to meld.
    
    4. Use the back of a spoon to make a well near the perimeter and crack the egg directly into it. Repeat with the remaining egg.

    5. Cover with a lid and cook over a medium-low heat, checking often. They eggs are done when the eggwhites are an opaque white.

    6. Take off the heat and top with fresh cilantro leaves. Serve in bowls with crusty bread on the side.

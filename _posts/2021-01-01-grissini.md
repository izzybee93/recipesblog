  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 375g strong white bread flour, divided
    * 160ml water
    * 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
    * 4g dry yeast
  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, combine 180g of flour, water and oil.
    Knead until a creamy dough forms.\n2. Dissolve the dry yeast in 2 tbsp water.
    Add to the dough, along with the remaining flour, and mix for about 20 minutes,
    until the dough is smooth.\n3. Transfer the dough to a floured surafce and pat
    into a flat rectangle. Fold along the longest side, folding the top third of the
    dough inwards, then overlap with the bottom third, to form a long rectangle. Cover
    with a damp tea-towel and leave to rise for 1 hour.\n4. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C
    and line a baking tray with parchment paper. \n5. Cut a 1.5cm thick piece of dough
    from the shorter side of the rectangle. Stretch it gently with your hands, starting
    from the center and tugging towards the ends until it is the length of the tray.
    Alternatively, twisting two sticks together to vary the shape. Place on the tray.
    Repeat with the remaining dough, spacing the breadsticks 2-3cm apart.\n6. Bake
    for 13-15 minutes. To get more evenly browned grissini, turn them around in the
    last few minutes of baking. Transfer to a wire rack to cool."

    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a loaf tin or muffin tin.
    2. In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt, then mix.
    3. Combine the oil, milk, lemon juice and lemon zest and mix well. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and gently fold together, then fold in the blueberries.
    4. Pour the batter into the tin or divide between muffin cases. Bake the loaf for 45-55 minutes, or muffins for 20 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. If using frozen blueberries, it may take a couple of minutes longer. Place on a cooling rack and leave to cool before serving.

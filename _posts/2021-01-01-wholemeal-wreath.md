    1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and yeast. In a medium bowl, mix together the oil, sugar and water, then add to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.
    2. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 15 minutes, until the dough is elastic.
    3. Lightly grease the bowl with oil. Place the dough inside and cover with a damp tea-towel. Leave to rise for about an hour, until doubled in size.
    4. Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Roll the dough into a 45cm long log and slice in half lengthways. Attach the logs at one end and twist the two lengths of dough together. Place on the tray and pinch the two ends together to make a wreath. Top with mixed seeds.
    5. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for another hour, until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
    6. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the base of the wreath sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack.

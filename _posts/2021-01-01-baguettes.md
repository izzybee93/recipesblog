  servings: makes 3 baguettes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 500g strong white or wholemeal bread flour
    * 2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast
    * 10g sea salt
    * ~450ml warm water
  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and salt. Add the
    water and mix until all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be wet and
    not kneadable. Adjust with more water or flour if needed.\n2. Cover and leave
    to rest for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. Perform a stretch and fold with at
    least 6 folds. Leave to rest for another 2-4 hours. At this stage, either bake
    immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days for flavour development.\n3. When
    ready to bake, if refrigerated, remove the bowl from the fridge for an hour before
    baking. \n4. Lightly dust a baguette tray with flour. Divide the dough into 3
    pieces. For each piece, fold the sides inwards then rotate the dough by 90 degrees.
    Gently stretch into a baguette shape and place on the tray. Cover with a damp
    towel and leave to rest for an hour.\n5. Preheat to 220Â°C, for 30 minutes prior
    to baking. Cut 3 or 4 slashes into the dough to allow the air to escape. Pour
    water into a tray at the base of the oven to create steam. Bake for about 30 minutes,
    until deep golden and crispy. Cool on a wire rack before slicing."

    * 325-400ml room temperature water

    1. The day before baking, in a large bowl, add the flour, sugar and water. Mix together and let the dough rest for an hour.
    2. Add the salt mixed with 15g water and dimple your fingers into the dough to allow the salty water and salt to distribute evenly throughout the dough. Leave for 10 minutes.
    3. Add the sourdough starter and mix well. Wet your hands then lift and fold the dough over, do a quarter turn of the bowl and repeat three more times. Repeat 3 times at 30 minute intervals with a final 15 minute rest at the end. Cover the bowl with a damp tea-towel and leave to rest for 4 hours. Transfer to the fridge overnight, about 12 hours.
    4. The next day, divide the dough into 8 equal parts. Roll each piece of dough on the counter to form a ball, and shape into buns. Arrange on a lined baking tray, keeping even spacing in between the buns. Cover with a damp tea-towel and let it rest for 4-6 hours until almost doubled in size.
    5. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Lightly brush the buns with milk. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 30 minutes. Let the buns cool completely on a wire rack. Once cool, slice and enjoy with your favourite filling.

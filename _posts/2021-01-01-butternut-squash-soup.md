    1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a rimmed baking tray with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the tray and brush with oil.
    2. Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (the skin may brown at this point). Set aside until it’s cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
    3. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until softened, stirring frequently. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat.
    4. Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into the saucepan. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and some black pepper.  Pour in half the vegetable stock. Blend with a hand blender until creamy. Add the remaining broth if needed. Season to taste.
    5. Place the soup over a medium heat and simmer until hot, stirring often. Serve topped with black pepper.

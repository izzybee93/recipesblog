  directions_markdown: "1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Brush a bundt tin with vegan
    butter or oil then lightly dust it with cocoa powder. \n2. In a large bowl, add
    the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Mix until combined.
    Add the milk, oil and apple cider vinegar and mix until just combined, with some
    lumps remaining. Do not overmix the batter as it will be mixed it again.\n3. Pour
    half of the cake mixture into another bowl. \n4. Add the vanilla extract to one
    bowl of cake batter and mix until just combined. \n5. Add the cocoa powder and
    milk to the other bowl of cake batter. Mix until just combined and ensure each
    batter is the same consistency.\n6. To create a marble effect, add the cake batter
    to the tin using 2 ladles. Pour 1 ladle of chocolate batter in one side of the
    bundt tin. Pour 1 ladle of the vanilla batter directly on top. Both cake batters
    will naturally spread. Keep alternating until there is no more cake batter.\n7.
    Bake the cake in the oven for 50-60 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre
    comes out clean.\n8. Allow the cake to cool in
    the tin for 10 minutes. Turn the bundt tin upside down on a plate and gently tap
    the tin until the cake is removed. Allow to cool completely before glazing.\n9.
    To make the glaze, add the chocolate to a glass bowl and melt using a bain-marie.
    In a measuring jug, microwave the soya milk 30 seconds or until warm. Pour the
    warm milk over the chocolate and let sit for 2-3 minutes.\n10. Whisk the chocolate
    and milk together until smooth. Add the coconut oil and stir in to make a shiny
    glaze. Leave the glaze to cool until thick enough to pour over the cake without
    being too runny.\n11. Drizzle generously over the cake, letting it drip down the
    sides."

    1. Chill the chocolate chips in the freezer until needed.
    2. In large bowl, beat together the butter, sugar and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Add the aquafaba and continue to mix.
    3. In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder together.
    4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, and mix until a soft dough forms. Add the chocolate chips into the dough. Shape into a ball then let it rest in freezer for about 15 minutes.
    5. Prepare a baking tray lined with baking paper and preheat the oven to 170°C.
    6. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and roll out to a thickness of about 8mm. Make circles with a small pastry cutter, then shape the tip to give the classic shape of Gocciole and place on the tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until slightly browned. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.

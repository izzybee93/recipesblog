  directions_markdown: "1. In a small bowl, add in the dried fruit then the boiling water
    and set aside. \n2. Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with baking
    paper.\n3. In a large bowl, add the flour, salt and sugar and mix together. Add
    the butter and rub together with your fingertips until it starts to look like
    breadcrumbs. Drain the dries fruit, then stir into the flour mixture.\n4. In a separate bowl, mix the starter,
    milk and vanilla extract. Gently fold the starter mixture into the flour mixture,
    a little at a time, until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. \n5. Tip out the
    dough onto a floured surface and roll out to about 3cm thick. Using a round cutter
    dipped in flour, cut out the scones. Place on the prepared baking tray and brush
    with milk. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack
    to cool."

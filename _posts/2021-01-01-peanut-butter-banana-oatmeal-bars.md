    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a 8x8 glass dish with baking paper.
    2. In a large bowl mash the bananas. Add oat milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, chia seeds and peanut butter. Mix until combined.
    3. Add the oats, salt if using unsalted peanut butter, and cinnamon. Mix well until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.
    4. Spread the mixture evenly into the dish and press down. Bake for 25 minutes until golden brown. It will become firmer as it cools. Let it rest for 30 minutes before cutting.
    5. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days. If freezing, make sure to cut the bars into squares and layer baking paper in between. Let them thaw for 30 minutes before serving.

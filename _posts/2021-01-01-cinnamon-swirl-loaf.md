    1. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and yeast, and set aside.
    2. Gently warm the milk with 125ml water and the butter, until lukewarm and the butter has melted.
    3. Remove from the heat, then add the aquafaba. Mix until combined.
    4. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mix and work together to make a soft but not sticky dough.
    5. Knead for 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchy. Shape into a ball and place in a large preheated bowl. Leave to prove for 1 hour, covered with a damp tea towel.
    6. Meanwhile, make the filling. Mix the caster sugar, flour and cinnamon together in a small bowl and set aside.  Preheat a large loaf tin to 50°C.
    7. After an hour, punch the proved dough down and roll into a rectangle as wide as the loaf tin.
    8. Brush with the melted butter, sprinkle over the filling then roll the dough up like a swiss roll, to fit inside the loaf tin.
    9. Leave the dough to prove for one more hour. Preheat the oven to 180°C. 
    10. After an hour and the loaf has risen, brush with soya milk and bake for 35-40 minutes. It will be ready when the top is golden brown and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped. Leave to cool completely before serving.

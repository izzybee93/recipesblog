    1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Prepare two cake tins.
    2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda.  
    3. In a measuring jug, mix the milk, oil and coffee mixture. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until smooth. Stir through the chopped walnuts.
    4. Divide the mixture evenly between the two tins. Bake for 20-22 minutes until an inserted skewer or knife comes out clean.
    5. Leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack, remove the baking parchment and leave to cool completely or overnight before decorating.
    6. In a medium bowl, add the sugar and butter and beat together with a hand mixer.
    7. Mix the instant coffee and milk into a paste and add to the icing. 
    8. Mix well, starting at low speed and gradually increasing until the frosting thickens and becomes smooth.
    9. Spread at least a third of the icing on the first cake layer. Place the second layer on top and another third of the icing on top. Pipe decorations with the remaining icing.

    1. Mix the instant coffee and boiling water to a paste and leave to cool.
    2. Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Line a cake tin or loaf tin with greaseproof paper.
    3. In a large bowl, combine the flour, caster sugar and baking powder, and set aside. 
    4. In a measuring jug, mix together the milk, oil and coffee. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until just combined. Stir in the chopped walnuts.
    5. Pour the mixture into the tin. Tap it firmly on the work surface, then bake for 30-35 minutes until skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.
    6. To make the icing, dissolve 2 tsp instant coffee in 1-2 tbsp water. Combine the icing sugar and coffee to make a thick icing. Using a palette knife, spread over the top of the cake and leave to set.

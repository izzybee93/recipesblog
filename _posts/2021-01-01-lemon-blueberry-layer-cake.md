    1. First make the filling: In a pan, combine blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat until the blueberries are soft and the sauce has thickened, stirring constantly. Allow to cool in the fridge.
    2. For the cake, add the apple cider vinegar and non-dairy milk to a measuring jug without stirring, then set aside for 5 minutes.
    3. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line two cake tins with parchment paper and grease the sides.
    4. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and salt.
    5. Stir the oil, vanilla, and lemon zest into the vegan buttermilk. Add to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not over-mix.
    6. Divide the batter evenly between the tins and bake for 25-30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool before assembling.
    7. To assemble the cake, cover one layer with blueberry filling. Place the second layer on top and dust with icing sugar.

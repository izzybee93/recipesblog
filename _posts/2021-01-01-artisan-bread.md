    1. In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and salt. Add the water and mix until all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be wet and not kneadable. Adjust with more water or flour if needed.
    2. Cover and leave to rest for 2 - 3 hours until doubled in size. It should be wobbly with bubbles on top. At this stage, you can either bake immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days for flavour development.
    3. When ready to bake, if refridgerated, remove the bowl from the fridge for an hour before baking. Preheat to 220Â°C, for 30 minutes prior to baking. Place lid of the baking dish or a baking tray in the oven to preheat.
    4. Shape the dough by folding the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a round shape.
    5. Remove the lid or tray from the oven. Place the dough on the floured lid and put the pot on top (upside down). Alternatively, place on a lined baking tray and pour water in a tray at the base of the oven to create steam. Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy. Cool on wire rack before slicing.

    1. Preheat the oven to 190°C. Line two large baking trays with baking paper.
    2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add in the peanut butter and vanilla and mix until well combined.
    3. In a separate bowl mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet, and mix until the dough becomes thick and crumbly. Add the soya milk, until the dough comes together. Add a little more milk if needed.
    4. Add the chocolate and mix until evenly distributed though the dough.
    5. Scoop a tbsp of dough, roll into a large ball and place on the tray. Flatten each ball with the back of a spoon. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the tops are golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool - the middle will still be very soft and will become firm as they cool.

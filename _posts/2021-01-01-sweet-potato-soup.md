    1. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Place the sweet potatoes and carrots on a large roasting tin, drizzled with 2 tbsp oil and season. Roast in the oven for 25-30 mins or until tender.
    2. Meanwhile, add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to a large saucepan and fry the onion over a medium-low heat, for about 10 mins until softened. Add the garlic and stir for 1 min. 
    3. Once the vegetables are roasted, leave to cool a little, then transfer to the saucepan. Add the stock and simmer for 5 mins. 
    4. Use a hand blender to process until smooth. Stir in the cream if using, a little more seasoning and reheat. Serve in bowls topped with black pepper.

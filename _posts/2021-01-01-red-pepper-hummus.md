    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Place the peppers on a tray, coated with the oil. Roast for 15 mins, until starting to brown at the edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

    2. Combine the tahini and lemon juice in a food processor and mix for 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl then process for 30 more seconds.

    2. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and salt. Process for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides, then process another 30 seconds. Add the roasted peppers, and process for 30 seconds, until well blended.
    
    3. Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas and process for 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add a tbsp water and process, until it reaches the desired consistency.

    4. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a sprinkle of paprika. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to one week.

  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 480g white bread flour
    * 7g instant yeast
    * 8g sea salt
    * 380g lukewarm water
    * 150g olives, sliced
  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, yeast and salt.
    Add the water and mix well to form a sticky dough. Add the olives and mix through.
    \n\n2. Cover and leave to rest for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. Perform a
    stretch and fold with at least 6 folds. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight.\n\n3.
    Remove from the fridge and leave to rest for 1 hour before handling. \n\n4. Shape
    the dough by folding the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a round
    shape. Place back in the bowl, cover and leave to rise for 1 hour. \n\n5. Preheat
    to 220Â°C 30 minutes prior to baking. Place lid of the baking dish or a baking
    tray in the oven to preheat.\n\n6. Remove the lid or tray from the oven. Place
    the dough on the floured lid. Cut 3 or 4 slashes into the dough to allow the air
    to escape. Place the dish on top, or if using a baking tray, pour water into a
    tray at the base of the oven to create steam. \n\n7. Bake for 40 minutes, then
    remove the lid and bake the bread uncovered for a further 10-15 minutes until
    browned and crisp. Leave to cool on a wire rack before slicing."

  directions_markdown: "1. For the berry filling, add the frozen berries, sugar and
    lemon juice to a medium sized pan. Stir over medium heat until it starts to boil.
    Reduce the heat to low and allow the filling to simmer for 15-20 minutes, until
    thickened slightly. Remove from heat and pour the berry filling into a bowl. Refrigerate
    for at least 2 hours or until completely chilled.\n2. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
    Prepare three 20cm round cake pans. \n3. In a large bowl, mix together the flour,
    sugar, cornflour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.\n4. In a measuring jug,
    whisk together the milk, oil, vinegar and vanilla extract.\n5. Add the wet ingredients
    to the dry and mix until combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared
    cake pans and bake for 35 minutes,until a skewer inserted into the centre comes
    out clean.\n6. Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then gently remove from the pans
    and leave to cool completely.\n7. For the frosting, add the vegan butter and coconut
    oil to a medium bowl. Beat together until smooth, using mixer with balloon whisk.
    Add in the icing sugar a bit at a time and beat for 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla
    extract and beat for another minute. The frosting should be smooth and pipeable
    but not so soft that it slumps.\n8. To assemble the cake, spread about 1/6 of
    the frosting evenly over the first cake layer, then pipe a frosting dam along
    the edge to hold in the berry filling. Gently spread 1/2 the berry filling over
    the top of the frosting, taking care not to press in and lift any of the buttercream
    into the berry layer. Add the next cake layer and repeat until you have your 3
    cake layers assembled with the berry layer and frosting. Smooth a thin layer of
    frosting on the top and around the sides of the cake.\n9. Top with an assortment
    of fresh berries and mint leaves. The cake stores best in the fridge. Remove it
    from the fridge about 30 minutes before serving."

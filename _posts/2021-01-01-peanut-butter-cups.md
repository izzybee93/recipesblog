    * 1 tablespoon coconut oil
    * 60g natural peanut butter

    1. Line a tray with 12 cupcake liners.
    2. Place the chocolate in a glass bowl, and melt over a pan of boiling water. Stir in the coconut oil.
    3. Spoon a little bit of melted chocolate into each cup, spreading a thin layer up the edges of the liners. This will ensure the peanut butter is encased in the chocolate. Transfer to the fridge for 5-10 minutes to set slightly.
    5. Remove from the fridge and divide the peanut butter equally, spooning it into the centre of each cup. Top with the remaining chocolate to cover.
    7. Transfer to the fridge for 1 hour to set.

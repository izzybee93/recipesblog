    1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C and line two large baking trays.
    2. In a medium bowl, sift the self-raising flour and cocoa powder, then set aside.
    3. In a large bowl, rub the orange zest and sugar together using your fingers. Cream the orange sugar and the butter together until pale, then add the aquafaba.
    4. Fold the dry ingredients into the mixture until combined. Add a splash of freshly squeezed orange juice to help the mixture come together.
    5. Add the chocolate to the dough and mix until the chocolate is evenly dispersed.
    8. Take a heaped tbsp of dough, shape into a ball, and place on a tray, then flatten. Make sure to space out the cookies, 8 per tray.
    9. Bake for 15-18 minutes. They will look undercooked when they come out of the oven, but will harden as they cool.

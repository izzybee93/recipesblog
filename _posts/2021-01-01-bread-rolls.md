    * 500g white bread flour
    * 7g instant yeast
    * 6g sea salt
    * 2 tbsp caster sugar or honey

  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.
    Add the oil and water and mix until a dough forms.\n2. If using the kneading method,
    knead for 10 minutes until soft, smooth and stretchy. Return to the bowl and leave
    to rest for about 2 hours, until doubled in size. \n3. If using the no-knead method,
    cover and leave for 30 minutes, then mix again. Leave for 1-2 hours until doubled
    in size. Lightly punch down the dough and perform at least 3 stretch and folds.
    Cover and leave for 2-3 hours, until doubled in size, or leave in the fridge overnight.
    Remove from the fridge for at least one hour before continuing.\n4. Prepare a
    baking tray with baking paper. Turn out the dough onto a lightly oiled surface.
    Divide into 12 equal pieces (about 70g each). Stretch the dough and fold the sides
    underneath, then roll into a ball. Place the rolls on the tray, spaced about 2cm apart.
    Loosely cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise until puffy and doubled
    in size, for about 1 hour.\n5. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Bake for 15-17 minutes
    until lightly browned.\n6. Transfer to a cooling rack and cover with a tea towel to keep the rolls soft on top."

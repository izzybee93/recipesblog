  directions_markdown: "1. Combine all the dough ingredients in a large bowl. Mix
    until all ingredients come together.\n2. Knead the dough on a lightly floured
    surface  for 10-15 minutes. The dough is ready when it's soft and stretchy.\n3.
    Place the dough in a bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Leave to rest in a
    warm place for at least 1 hour or until doubled in size.\n4. Shape: Line a 20cm
    loaf tin with baking paper.\n5. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough
    into a rectangle shape around 25x20 cm. The long side of the dough should be a
    little longer than the length of your loaf tin. \n6. Spread the jam filling onto
    the dough leaving a 1cm border around the edge.\n7. Starting from the long side,
    roll the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthways.
    Carefully twirl the two strips together, with the cut side facing up to show the
    layers.\n8. Lift the dough into your loaf tin, slightly squashing it to the length
    of the tin. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside to rise for at least 1 hour.
    The babka is ready when it rises by 20% and looks soft and puffy. If leaving to
    rest overnight, place in the fridge.\n9. Bake: Remove from the fridge and bring
    it back to room temperature before baking, leaving to rest for 1-2 hours. Preheat
    your oven to 170°C.\n10. Bake for 35 minutes, until golden brown. If the top of
    is browning too quickly reduce the heat to 150°C and cover with foil. Remove from
    the oven and let cool before serving. The babka is best eaten on the day it is
    baked. Alternatively, store it an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2
    days. Warm up the leftovers before serving."

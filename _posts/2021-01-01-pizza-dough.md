  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 320ml warm water
    * 7g easy bake yeast
    * 1 tbsp granulated sugar
    * 2 tbsp (30ml) olive oil
    * 1 tsp sea salt
    * 225g strong white bread flour
    * 225g plain flour
  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, whisk the warm water, yeast and granulated
    sugar together. \n2. In a medium bowl, combine the bread flour, plain flour and
    salt.\n3. Add the olive oil to the wet mixture, followed by the flour mixture
    and mix until combined. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead
    for 5-10 minutes, until soft and allows some light through when stretched.\n3.
    Lightly grease the bowl with oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a
    damp kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes
    or until double in size. If making the dough the day before, divide the dough
    into 2 balls, place in an airtight container and transfer to the fridge after
    it has risen. \n4. Preheat oven to 220°C. Allow it to heat for at least 15-20
    minutes as you shape the pizza. If the dough was stored in the fridge overnight,
    allow to warm up to room temperature for at least 30 mins.\n5. Shape the dough.
    When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles, then divide
    in half. On a lightly floured work surface, gently roll the dough into a disc.
    Place on prepared pan, then stretch and flatten the into a circle, about 1cm thick.
    If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, cover it for 5-10
    minutes, then try again.\n6. Cover and allow to rest for a few minutes as you
    prepare the toppings. Top with your favourite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes
    or until the crust is golden brown."

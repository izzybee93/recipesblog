    * 585g self-raising flour
    * 400g granulated sugar
    * 40g cornflour
    * 1½ tsp baking powder
    * ¾ tsp baking soda
    * ½ tsp salt
    * 750ml soya milk
    * 310ml vegetable oil
    * 5 tbsp apple cider vinegar
    * 4 tsp vanilla extract
    * 80g vegan chocolate drops

    * 150g vegan butter
    * 50g coconut oil
    * 400g icing sugar, sifted
    * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  directions_markdown: "1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Prepare three 20cm round cake
    pans.\n2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, cornflour, baking powder,
    baking soda and salt.\n3. In a measuring jug, whisk together the milk, oil, vinegar
    and vanilla extract.\n4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until combined.
    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared\ncake pans and bake for 35 minutes, until
    a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.\n6. Leave to cool for 10 minutes,
    then gently remove from the pans and leave to cool completely.\n7. Place one cake
    on the serving plate. Use a large round cookie cutter to cut out the centre of
    two of the cakes. Save the centre for later, or use them to layer on top if desired.\n7.
    For the frosting, add the vegan butter and coconut oil to a medium bowl. Beat
    together until smooth, using mixer with balloon whisk. Add in the icing sugar
    a bit at a time and beat for 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat for
    another minute. The frosting should be smooth and pipeable but not so soft that
    it slumps.\n8. To assemble the cake, spread about 1/6 of the frosting evenly over
    the first cake layer, then pipe a frosting dam along the edge to hold the chocolate
    hazelnut filling. Gently spread half the chocolate hazelnut filling over\nthe
    top of the frosting, taking care not to press in and lift any of the buttercream
    into the chocolate layer. Add the next cake layer and repeat until you have your
    2 cake layers assembled with the chocolate hazelnut and frosting. \n9. Fill the
    middle of the cake with chocolate drops. Place the third cake on top.\n10. Smooth
    a thin layer of frosting on the top and around the sides of the cake.\n11. Top
    with any leftover chocolate drops. The cake stores best in the fridge. Remove
    it from the fridge about 30 minutes before serving."

  directions_markdown: "1. Preheat the oven to 180°C and prepare a cake tin.\n2. In
    a large bowl, whisk together the flour, caster sugar, bicarbonate of soda, baking
    powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.\n3. In a measuring jug, combine the oil, applesauce,
    vanilla and milk. Add the wet mixture to the dry and stir until combined. The
    dough will be quite stiff - add a little more milk if needed, however the apples
    will provide a lot of moisture during baking.\n4. Fold in the diced apples and
    nuts. Pour the batter into the tin and spread evenly. Bake for 45-50 minutes,
    or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. \n5. Whilst cooling,
    whisk together the cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkle on top."

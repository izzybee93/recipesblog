  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 400g strong wholemeal bread flour
    * 100g strong white bread flour
    * 7g instant yeast
    * 1½ tsp sea salt
    * 50g vegan butter, melted
    * 1 tbsp dark brown sugar
    * 300ml warm water
    * 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda
    * 2L water
    * Handful sesame seeds
    * Oil for brushing
  directions_markdown: "1. In a large bowl, combine the flours, yeast and salt. \n2.
    In a measuring jug, stir together the melted butter, sugar and water. Add to the
    dry ingredients and mix until the dough comes together.\n3. Tip the dough onto
    a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.\n4. Lightly grease the bowl
    with some oil. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and
    leave to rise until doubled in size – about 2 hours.\n5. Knock back the dough
    by gently kneading a few times to get the air out. Line two baking sheets with
    baking paper. Cut the dough into 9 even pieces, using weighing scales. Roll each
    piece into a ball and place on the sheets, leaving space between each.\n6. Cover
    with a tea towel and leave to prove until doubled in size again, 1-2 hours. \n7.
    Preheat the oven to 200°C and fill a large saucepan with water.\n8. Bring the
    pan to the boil, then lower the heat to gently simmering and stir in the bicarbonate
    of soda - this will give the bagels a darker crust. Use a floured finger to push
    a hole through the centre of each dough ball, and stretch the hole by gently swirling
    the bagel around on your finger, then put it in the pan. Poach 2 bagels at a time,
    for 30 seconds then turn over and poach for another 30 seconds. Use a slotted
    spoon to return the bagels to the baking trays. Poach all the bagels, keeping
    the water at a gentle simmer.\n9. Brush the bagels with oil and sprinkle with
    some seeds. Bake for 15 minutes until brown and crisp. Transfer to a cooling rack.
    Enjoy toasted with your favourite filling."

servings: makes 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - 150g self-raising flour
  - 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda

  - 2 medium or 3 small overripe bananas
  - 85g light brown sugar

  - 100g sourdough starter/discard
  - 50ml oat milk

    In a medium bowl, combine the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt,
    and set aside.

    In a separate bowl, mash the bananas. Add the sugar, oil, milk and sourdough
    starter. Stir together until smooth.

    Add the dry ingredients to the wet. Stir together until combined but try not

    Pour the batter into the loaf tin. Bake for 50-60 minutes until a toothpick
    inserted into the centre of the loaf comes out clean. If the loaf looks like
    it's browning too much but is not cooked through yet, cover with foil for
    the last 20 minutes of baking. Allow to cool before serving.

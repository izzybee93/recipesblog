servings: serves 3
ingredients:
  - '6 slices sourdough bread, sliced about 1.5cm thick'
  - 230ml soya milk
  - 2 tsp maple syrup
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 4 tbsp whole wheat plain flour
  - 1 tsp ground flaxseed
  - 1 tsp cinnamon
  - 'Vegan butter, for frying'
  - 150g blueberries
  - 1 tbsp maple syrup
directions:
  - >-
    In a shallow bowl, whisk together the milk, maple syrup, vanilla, flour,
    flaxseed, and cinnamon.
  - Heat the frying pan and add a little bit of vegan butter.
  - >-
    Whisk the batter again before dipping bread, as the flour will settle to the
    bottom of the bowl. Dip each side in the batter and let soak for about 10
    seconds, then add the bread to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each
    side, until golden brown.
  - >-
    Meanwhile, to make the blueberry topping, gently heat the maple syrup and
    blueberries in a saucepan until the berries start to pop and release their
    juices. Continue to stir on a low heat until slightly thickened.

servings: makes 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - 225g strong stoneground wholemeal flour
  - 225g strong stoneground white flour
  - 8g fine sea salt
  - 7g instant dry yeast
  - 3 tbsp poppy seeds
  - 3 tbsp sunflower seeds
  - 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds
  - 350ml warm water
directions:
  - >-
    In a large bowl, combine the wholemeal and white flour. Add the salt, yeast
    and seeds, and mix thoroughly.
  - >-
    Make a well in the centre and pour in the water. Mix to gradually form a
    dough, adding more water or flour if needed. Continue to mix with your hands
    until you have a smooth dough that leaves the bowl clean. Transfer to a
    lightly floured surface and knead for 10 mins, until the dough stretches
    enough to see light through it without breaking.
  - >-
    Shape the dough into a ball. Brush a bowl with oil and place the dough
    inside, covering with a damp tea towel. Leave to prove for 1-2 hours, until
    doubled in size.
  - >-
    Stretch the dough into an oblong, then fold one edge into the centre and the
    other over that. Place in a loaf tin and sprinkle with flour, then cover
    again with a tea towel and leave to rise for another 30 minutes at room
    temperature, until the centre is about 2cm above the height of the tin.
  - >-
    Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. When the dough has risen enough, bake for 40
    minutes. Cook for a further 5-10 minutes if you prefer the crust to be
    crispy. Remove from the tin and leave to cool on a wire rack. Tapping the
    base of the loaf should sound hollow if cooked.

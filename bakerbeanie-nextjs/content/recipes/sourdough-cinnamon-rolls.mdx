  - 30g caster sugar

  - ¼ tsp nutmeg
  - ¼ tsp ginger

directions:
  - >-
    In the afternoon before baking, in small bowl, whisk together the soy milk,
    melted butter, aquafaba and sugar.
  - >-
    Stir in the starter, until well combined. Sift in the flour and salt and mix
    until a shaggy dough forms. Scape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
    Cover and leave to rest for 15 minutes.
  - >-
    Take a corner of the dough ball, pull it up to stretch it, and fold it
    inwards, towards the centre. Rotate the bowl by a quarter turn, and repeat
    the folding process for a total of four times. Now cover with a damp towel
    and rest for 30 mins. Perform 3 more stretch and folds with 30 mins rest.
    Place in the fridge overnight until it is doubled in size (8-12 hours).

    The next day, place the dough on a floured surface. Flour your rolling pin,
    and roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 2cm thick. Roll it out
    with the longer edge of the rectangle closest to you.

    Melt the vegan butter for the filling, and brush it over the rectangle of
    dough. Mix together the sugar and spices in a small bowl, and sprinkle
    evenly over the buttered dough.
  - >-
    Flour your hands, and gently roll the dough up, starting with the long edge,
    into a tight roll.
  - Cut the log into 4cm thick pieces with a large knife.

    Place the rolls in a lined with parchment cake pan. Leaving some space
    between them as they will puff up during the second prove. Cover and leave
    to rest for 1-2 hours until the rolls look puffier (no need for them to
    double in size). Bake at 180°C for 40 minutes, or until golden and fragrant.

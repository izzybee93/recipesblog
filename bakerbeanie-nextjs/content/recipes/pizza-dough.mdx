servings: makes 2 pizzas
ingredients:
  - 320ml warm water
  - 7g easy bake yeast
  - 1 tbsp granulated sugar
  - 2 tbsp (30ml) olive oil
  - 1 tsp sea salt
  - 225g strong white bread flour

    Add the olive oil to the wet mixture, followed by the flour mixture and mix
    until combined. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for
    5-10 minutes, until soft and allows some light through when stretched.
  - "Lightly grease the bowl with oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature\_for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. If making the dough the day before, divide the dough into 2 balls, place in an airtight container and transfer to the fridge after it has risen."

    Preheat oven to 220Â°C. Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you
    shape the pizza. If the dough was stored in the fridge overnight, allow to
    warm up to room temperature for at least 30 mins.

    Shape the dough. When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air
    bubbles, then divide in half. On a lightly floured work surface, gently roll
    the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan, then stretch and flatten the
    into a circle, about 1cm thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try
    to stretch it, cover it for 5-10 minutes, then try again.

    Cover and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare the toppings. Top
    with your favourite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust
    is golden brown.

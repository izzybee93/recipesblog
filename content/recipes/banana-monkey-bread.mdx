servings: serves 12
ingredients:
  - '2 medium overripe bananas, mashed'
  - '160ml non-dairy milk, lukewarm'
  - 40g caster sugar
  - 550g white bread flour
  - 7g instant yeast
  - 8g sea salt
  - '50g vegan butter, softened'
  - '100g vegan butter, melted'
  - 200g light brown soft sugar
  - 1½ tbsp cinnamon
  - 1 tsp ground ginger
  - 1 tsp ground nutmeg
  - '100g pecans or walnuts, roughly chopped'
directions:
  - 'In a large bowl, mix together the mashed banana, milk and sugar.'
  - >-
    Add the flour, yeast and salt and mix to form a rough dough. Transfer the
    dough to a surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth and soft.
  - >-
    Transfer back to the bowl and add the butter. Mix into the dough using your
    hands, then transfer to the surface and continue to knead for 5-10 minutes,
    until the dough can stretch it to a thin windowpane without it tearing.
  - >-
    Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and set aside to rise in a
    warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours. If baking the next day,
    transfer the dough to the fridge. Ensure to remove the dough from the fridge
    at least an hour before continuing the next step.
  - >-
    Grease a bundt tin. Mix together the sugar and spices in a wide, shallow
    bowl. Spoon 2 tbsp of melted butter, 3 tbsp of spiced sugar, and 4 tbsp of
    chopped nuts into the base of the tin.
  - >-
    Knock back the dough and knead briefly. Tear small pieces of dough off and
    roll them into small balls, around 50 in total.
  - >-
    Dunk each dough ball in the melted butter, then roll in the spiced sugar
    until fully coated. Place in the tin and repeat until the tin contains a
    full layer. Scatter over the some remaining nuts, then continue to layer the
    coated dough balls in the tin.
  - >-
    Cover the tin and leave to rise in a warm place for about an hour. It is
    ready to bake when the dough is puffy and has risen by at least 20%
  - >-
    When the dough is nearly ready, preheat the oven to 180°C. Bake for 35-45
    minutes until nicely browned and crisp on top. A probe thermometer inserted
    into the centre should reach at least 90°C.
  - >-
    Allow to cool in the tin for about 30 minutes before turning it out onto a
    serving plate. Best served warm and freshly baked.

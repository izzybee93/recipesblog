servings: "makes 1 loaf"
ingredients:
  - 180g strong wholemeal flour
  - 180g strong white flour
  - 180g chickpea or besan flour
  - 8g fine sea salt
  - 7g instant dry yeast
  - 3 tbsp sesame seeds
  - 3 tbsp sunflower seeds
  - 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds
  - 400ml warm water
directions:
  - In a large bowl, combine the flour. Add the salt, yeast and 2 tbsp of each of the seeds, and mix well. 
  - Add the water and mix until all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be wet and not kneadable. Adjust with more water or flour if needed.
  - Cover and leave to rest for 2-3 hours until doubled in size. Perform a stretch and fold with at least 6 folds. Leave to rest for another 3-4 hours. At this stage, either bake immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days for flavour development.
  - When ready to bake, if refrigerated, remove the bowl from the fridge for an hour before shaping.
  - Stretch the dough into an oblong, then fold one edge into the centre and the other over that. Place in a loaf tin, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for 1 hour at room temperature, until the centre is about 1cm above the height of the tin.
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C. When the dough has risen enough, bake for 45-50 minutes. Cook for a further 5-10 minutes for a crispy crust. Remove from the tin and leave to cool on a wire rack. Tapping the base of the loaf should sound hollow if cooked.

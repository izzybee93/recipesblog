    Remove the lid or tray from the oven. Place the dough on the floured lid.

    on top, or if using a baking tray, pour water into a tray at the base of the
    oven to create steam.

    Bake for 40 minutes, then remove the lid and bake the bread uncovered for a
    further 10-15 minutes until browned and crisp. Leave to cool on a wire rack
    before slicing.

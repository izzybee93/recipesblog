    Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a rimmed baking tray with parchment

    Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked
    through, about 40 to 50 minutes (the skin may brown at this point). Set
    aside until it’s cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.

    In a large saucepan, heat the remaining oil over medium heat. Add the onion
    and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until softened, stirring frequently. Add the
    garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the harissa paste, then remove
    from the heat.

    Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into the saucepan. Add
    the maple syrup, sage and some black pepper. Pour in half the vegetable
    stock. Blend with a hand blender until creamy. Add the remaining stock if
    needed. Season to taste.

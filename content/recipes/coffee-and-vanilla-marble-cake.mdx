ingredients:
  - '## Coffee cake'
  - 225g self-raising flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 50g caster sugar
  - 45g light brown sugar
  - Pinch sea salt
  - 10g instant coffee powder, dissolved in 1 tbsp cold water
  - 225ml soya milk
  - 75ml vegetable oil
  - '## Vanilla cake'
  - 225g self-raising flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 90g caster sugar
  - Pinch sea salt
  - 230ml soya milk
  - 75ml vegetable oil
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - '## Coffee cream filling'
  - 150ml vegan whipping cream
  - ½ tbsp icing sugar
  - 4g instant coffee powder, dissolved in 1 tbsp cold water
  - '## Icing'
  - 180g icing sugar
  - 4g instant coffee powder, dissolved in 1 tbsp cold water
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Prepare two cake tins.
  - In two medium bowls, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt for each cake.
  - In two measuring jugs, combine the milk and oil for each cake. Add the coffee mixture to one, and vanilla extract to the other and mix well.  
  - Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients for each cake and mix until smooth. 
  - To make the marble pattern, spoon 3 tbsp vanilla batter into the centre of each tin, then 3 tbsp coffee batter into the centre. Alternate with vanilla and coffee batter until batter is used up.
  - Using a skewer, starting at the side of the tin, slowly pull the batter towards the middle. Wipe the skewer clean then repeat from the opposite side, towards the middle. Make 12 lines in total. Bake for 20-22 minutes until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
  - Leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and leave to completely or overnight before decorating.
  - To make the coffee cream filling, add the cream to medium bowl and whip using a hand mixer for a few minutes. Add the icing sugar and continue to whip until soft peaks form.
  - Gradually add the coffee mixture while whipping until well combined. Transfer to the fridge to firm up a bit until ready to decorate the cake. 
  - To make the icing, mix 30g of the icing sugar with a teaspoon of water in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining icing sugar with the coffee to make a thick icing. 
  - To assemble the cake, spoon the coffee cream on the bottom layer, then carefully add the top layer. 
  - Using a palette knife, coat the top layer with the coffee icing. Drizzle the white icing in lines across the top and feather with a skewer. Decorate with walnuts, chocolate chips or your favourite toppings.

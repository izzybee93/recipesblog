servings: "serves 8-10"
ingredients:
  - 40g self-raising flour
  - 40g cocoa powder
  - 15g cornflour 
  - 1½ tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 1 pinch of salt
  - 100g caster sugar
  - 250ml non-dairy milk
  - 90g vegetable oil
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 400g cherries
  - 2 tbsp desiccated coconut
  - Fresh mint leaves 
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180 °C. Prepare a 22cm cake pan.
  - Pit the cherries by removing the stem, then using a chopstick or metal straw at the stem hole, gently but firmly press down into the pit and push it out of the cherry. Alternatively, halve the cherries and cut out the pit. Set aside a few whole cherries with stem and a few halved cherries for decoration.
  - Sift the flour, cornflour and cocoa powder into a large bowl. Add the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar, and salt and mix well.
  - In a measuring jug, whisk together milk, oil, vanilla extract and apple cider vinegar. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and mix until just combined.
  - Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread half of the cherries on top.  Pour the remaining batter on top and spread the remaining cherries on top.
  - Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
  - Remove from oven and let cool completely. Sprinkle the cake with desiccated coconut and garnish with the remaining cherries and mint leaves.

    In a large measuring jug, add the soy milk, applesauce/aquafaba, melted
    vegan butter and vanilla and mix together. Pour into the dry ingredients and
    mix well to combine. The batter will be similar to cake batter - not very thick
    but not too runny.

    Spoon the batter into the donut pan, filling about ¾ of the way full. Be
    careful not to overfill.

    Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Let cool
    for two or three minutes in the pan, then carefully transfer to a wire rack
    with a large piece of parchment paper beneath it.

    For the glaze topping, whisk together the icing sugar, soya milk and food
    colouring. Spoon over the doughnuts, or dip each doughnut in the glaze. Top
    with sprinkles. Allow to set before serving.

    For the cinnamon sugar topping, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. Brush
    each doughnut with melted butter, then dip in the cinnamon sugar. Best
    served the same day.

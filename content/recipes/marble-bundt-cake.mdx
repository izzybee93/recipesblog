servings: serves 16
ingredients:
  - 440g self-raising flour
  - 200g caster sugar
  - 3 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - ¼ tsp sea salt
  - 500g soya milk
  - 190g vegetable oil
  - 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 25g cocoa powder
  - 2 tbsp soya milk
  - 1 tbsp vanilla extract
  - '## Glaze'
  - 80g dark chocolate
  - 75ml soya milk
  - '½ tsp coconut oil, optional'
directions:
  - >-
    Preheat the oven to 180°C. Brush a bundt tin with vegan butter or oil then
    lightly dust it with cocoa powder.
  - >-
    In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda
    and salt. Mix until combined. Add the milk, oil and apple cider vinegar and
    mix until just combined, with some lumps remaining. Do not overmix the
    batter as it will be mixed it again.
  - Pour half of the cake mixture into another bowl.
  - >-
    Add the vanilla extract to one bowl of cake batter and mix until just
    combined.
  - >-
    Add the cocoa powder and milk to the other bowl of cake batter. Mix until
    just combined and ensure each batter is the same consistency.
  - >-
    To create a marble effect, add the cake batter to the tin using 2 ladles.
    Pour 1 ladle of chocolate batter in one side of the bundt tin. Pour 1 ladle
    of the vanilla batter directly on top. Both cake batters will naturally
    spread. Keep alternating until there is no more cake batter.
  - >-
    Bake the cake in the oven for 50-60 minutes or until a skewer inserted in
    the centre comes out clean.
  - >-
    Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Turn the bundt tin upside
    down on a plate and gently tap the tin until the cake is removed. Allow to
    cool completely before glazing.
  - >-
    To make the glaze, add the chocolate to a glass bowl and melt using a
    bain-marie. In a measuring jug, microwave the soya milk 30 seconds or until
    warm. Pour the warm milk over the chocolate and let sit for 2-3 minutes.
  - >-
    Whisk the chocolate and milk together until smooth. Add the coconut oil and
    stir in to make a shiny glaze. Leave the glaze to cool until thick enough to
    pour over the cake without being too runny.
  - 'Drizzle generously over the cake, letting it drip down the sides.'

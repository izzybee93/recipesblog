servings: "makes 1 loaf"
ingredients:
  - 500g strong white bread flour or plain flour
  - 475ml warm water
  - 7g dry instant yeast
  - 1 tsp caster sugar
  - 10g sea salt
  - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - '## Toppings'
  - 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 garlic clove, minced
  - 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
  - 1 tsp dried oregano (optional)
  - ½ tsp flaky sea salt
directions:
  - In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt and yeast and mix well. Add the water and mix well to form a sticky dough. Cover and leave to rest for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.
  - Perform a stretch and fold with at least 6 folds. Drizzle the top with 2 tbsp olive oil, then cover and leave to rest for another 2 hours. Refrigerate for 10-12 hours, or up to 3 days for flavour development.
  - Line a large dish or baking tray with baking paper. Wet your hands and transfer the dough to the dish, stretching it out carefully. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place for 2-4 hours until doubled in size.
  - To prepare the toppings, in a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, garlic, rosemary leaves, and oregano.
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C. Drizzle over the topping and press into the dough to make dimples all over the top. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
  - Immediately transfer to a wire rack and loosely cover with a tea towel to keep the crust soft. Leave to cool before serving.

  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda

    Add the apple cider vinegar to a measuring jug, then the oat milk. Set aside
    to form the buttermilk.

    Mix the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and sugar in a bowl. Add
    the butter and mix it in with your fingers until it starts to look a bit
    like breadcrumbs.
  - Add the milk a little at a time until you get the mixture coming together.

    Roll out dough. If it feels too wet, add a little more flour to the surface
    and turn it so that both sides are floured. Cut out little circles around
    2cm thick. Place on the prepared baking sheet and brush with soya milk. Bake
    until risen and golden, about 20 minutes.

servings: serves 16
ingredients:
  - 585g self-raising flour
  - 400g granulated sugar
  - 40g cornflour
  - 1½ tsp baking powder
  - ¾ tsp baking soda
  - ½ tsp sea salt
  - 750ml soya milk
  - 310ml vegetable oil
  - 5 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 4 tsp vanilla extract
  - 80g vegan chocolate drops
  - 4 tbsp chocolate hazelnut spread
  - 150g vegan butter
  - 50g coconut oil
  - '400g icing sugar, sifted'
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180°C. Prepare three 20cm round cake pans.
  - >-
    In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, cornflour, baking powder,
    baking soda and salt.
  - >-
    In a measuring jug, whisk together the milk, oil, vinegar and vanilla
    extract.
  - >-
    Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until combined. Divide the batter
    evenly between the prepared

    cake pans and bake for 35 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre
    comes out clean.
  - >-
    Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then gently remove from the pans and leave to
    cool completely.
  - >-
    Place one cake on the serving plate. Use a large round cookie cutter to cut
    out the centre of two of the cakes. Save the centre for later, or use them
    to layer on top if desired.
  - >-
    For the frosting, add the vegan butter and coconut oil to a medium bowl.
    Beat together until smooth, using mixer with balloon whisk. Add in the icing
    sugar a bit at a time and beat for 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and
    beat for another minute. The frosting should be smooth and pipeable but not
    so soft that it slumps.
  - >-
    To assemble the cake, spread about ⅙ of the frosting evenly over the first
    cake layer, then pipe a frosting dam along the edge to hold the chocolate
    hazelnut filling. Gently spread half the chocolate hazelnut filling over

    the top of the frosting, taking care not to press in and lift any of the
    buttercream into the chocolate layer. Add the next cake layer and repeat
    until you have your 2 cake layers assembled with the chocolate hazelnut and
    frosting.
  - >-
    Fill the middle of the cake with chocolate drops. Place the third cake on
    top.
  - Smooth a thin layer of frosting on the top and around the sides of the cake.
  - >-
    Top with any leftover chocolate drops. The cake stores best in the fridge.
    Remove it from the fridge about 30 minutes before serving.

    In a large pan, heat the water and add the salt. When boiling, gradually
    pour in the polenta, whisking constantly until there are no lumps. Whisk
    frequently on a low heat until it starts to thicken. Continue to cook and
    stir, using a spoon when the polenta becomes too thick for a whisk. When it
    reaches a creamy texture, remove from the heat and cover. Set aside for at
    least 5 minutes.

    medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste. Serve on
    a bed of polenta.

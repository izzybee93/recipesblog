  - 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
  - 2 heaped tsp mild curry powder

    with oil. Roast for 30 mins, or until soft.

    Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion
    and fry gently for 7-8 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic,
    chilli flakes, curry powder, tomato puree, peanut butter and a little dash
    of stock. Give everything a good mix to create a paste, then fry for another
    minute or so, until the spices release their aromas.

    Gently add the chunks of roasted sweet potato into the pan along with the
    rest of the vegetable stock and the chickpeas. Mix well, season generously
    with salt and pepper, then bring to a simmer for 5 minutes to reduce the
    sauce slightly.

    Stir in the spinach and lime juice. Allow the spinach to wilt before
    removing the pan from the heat.

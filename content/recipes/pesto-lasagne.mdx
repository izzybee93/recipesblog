  - 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast
  - '## Pesto'
  - 80g pine nuts
  - 80g cashews
  - '25g fresh basil, including stalks'

  - Juice of ½ lemon
  - 1 tablespoon of nutritional yeast
  - 125ml olive oil

  - 400ml almond milk (plus more if needed)
  - 50g nutritional yeast

    Make the pesto by placing all of the ingredients in a food processor and
    blending until a thick, green pesto forms. Once blended, place the pesto
    into a pan over a medium heat.

    Add the spinach and peas and heat until the spinach has wilted. Once wilted,
    turn off the heat and put to one side until needed.

    Make the white sauce by placing the corn flour, lemon juice, nutritional
    yeast, mustard, almond milk and a pinch of salt into a pan over a medium
    heat, and cook until the mixture begins to bubble, continuously whisking to
    ensure the mixture stays smooth and doesn’t form any lumps. Continue
    whisking until the mixture becomes thick and elastic-like. Remove from the
    heat and continue whisking to ensure it remains smooth - adding a dash more
    almond milk if it becomes too thick.

    Assemble the lasagne. Spoon one third of the pesto mixture onto the bottom
    of a baking dish. Cover with one layer of lasagne sheets, then top with one
    third of the white sauce. Repeat this process twice more, with pesto sauce,
    lasagne sheets, and white sauce. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast and place
    in the oven to cook for 35-40 minutes until bubbling and golden on top.

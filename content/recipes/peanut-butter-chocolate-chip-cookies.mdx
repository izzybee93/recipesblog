servings: makes 18
ingredients:
  - 85g vegan butter
  - 150g caster sugar
  - '285g salted peanut butter, smooth or crunchy'
  - 2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 190g plain flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp fine sea salt
  - 3 tbsp soya milk
  - 150g dark chocolate chips or chunks
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 190°C. Line two large baking trays with baking paper.
  - >-
    In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
    Add in the peanut butter and vanilla and mix until well combined.
  - >-
    In a separate bowl mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the
    dry ingredients to the wet, and mix until the dough becomes thick and
    crumbly. Add the soya milk, until the dough comes together. Add a little
    more milk if needed.
  - Add the chocolate and mix until evenly distributed though the dough.
  - >-
    Scoop a tbsp of dough, roll into a large ball and place on the tray. Flatten
    each ball with the back of a spoon. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the tops
    are golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool - the middle will still be
    very soft and will become firm as they cool.

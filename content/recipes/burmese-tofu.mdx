ingredients:
  - 120g chickpea flour or besan flour 
  - 1 tsp sea salt
  - ¼ tsp turmeric,
  - 720ml water, divided
directions:
  - Lightly oil a 20x20cm baking dish.
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, salt and turmeric. Add half the water and whisk until smooth.
  - Add the other half of the water to a saucepan and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the mixture. Whisk over the heat until the mixture becomes thick and glossy, for about 8 minutes.
  - Pour into the prepared baking dish and leave to cool at room temperature for 2 hours. It will get firmer if left for a longer time.

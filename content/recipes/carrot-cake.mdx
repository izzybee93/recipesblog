directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180°C and prepare 2 round 20cm cake pans.
  - In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt, spices and sugar.
  - In a measuring jug, whisk together the oil, soya milk, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar and orange zest. 
  - Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and mix together. Fold in the carrots and walnuts. 
  - Pour the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans, then bake for 40-45
    minutes, until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool
    completely before decorating.
  - To make the icing, beat the vegan butter in a medium bowl using mixer with balloon whisk. Add in the icing
    sugar a bit at a time and beat for 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and soya milk, and beat for another minute. 
    The frosting should be smooth and pipeable.
  - Assemble the cake with layers of icing and top with candied orange peel.

servings: makes 1 loaf
ingredients:

  - 500g strong white bread flour
  - 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
directions:

    Place the starter, salt, and water in a large bowl and stir to combine. Add
    the flour and mix again until fully incorporated. Leave for 30 minutes.

    Perform one fold: Pull the dough up and fold over. Turn the bowl in quarter
    turns and continue to pull and fold over 8 to 10 times. Cover and leave at
    room temperature for 4-8 hours, until doubled in size. In a clean bowl or
    container, drizzle and coat the dough with oil, then transfer to the fridge
    for 8-12 hours.

    The next morning, line a baking tray. Fold the dough envelope style from top
    to bottom and side to side to create a rough rectangle. Turn dough over so
    seam-side is down. Gently scoop the dough into the center of the tray. Brush
    the top of dough with oil. Leave for 4-6 hours, until puffy and nearly
    doubled.

    Heat the oven to 220ºC. Wet your hands, press your fingers gently into the
    dough to dimple and stretch the dough to nearly fit the pan. Sprinkle
    generously with sea salt / rosemary / garlic / oregano / tomato / olive /
    other toppings. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a cooling
    rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

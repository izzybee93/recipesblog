servings: makes 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - 100g sourdough starter
  - 200g strong white bread flour
  - 200g strong whole wheat bread flour
  - 280g water
  - 8g salt plus 15g water
  - 2 tbsp flax seeds
  - 2 tbsp poppy seeds
  - 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
  - 2 tbsp sunflower seeds
  - 2 tbsp white sesame seeds
  - 2 tbsp black sesame seeds
directions:
  - >-
    This process takes 8 hours, and the dough should be put in the fridge to
    prove overnight.
  - >-
    Mix: In a large bowl mix the flour and water together, and set aside for at
    least one hour at room temperature. Then add the starter and mix well, until
    all the ingredients come together into a large ball. Cover and let the dough
    rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours – this process is called Autolyse.
  - >-
    Fold: Add the salt mixed with water and dimple your fingers into the dough
    to allow the salty water and salt to distribute evenly throughout the dough.
    Leave for 10 minutes. Next, wet your hands then lift and fold the dough
    over, do a quarter turn of the bowl and repeat three more times. Repeat 3
    times at 30 minute intervals with a final 15 minute rest at the end.
  - >-
    Mix the seeds together in a small bowl. Add half of the seeds into the dough
    by flattening and folding the mixed seeds into the dough. Repeat until seeds
    are evenly distributed into the dough.
  - >-
    Shape: Transfer dough to a floured surface and sprinkle with a little flour.
    Shape into a tight ball by folding the edges over to the centre. Turn the
    dough over and push the dough back and forth to create a tight ball. Lightly
    press the dough and then dip it into the remaining mixed seeds in the
    shallow bowl. Swirl the dough to cover it evenly with seeds.
  - >-
    Prove: Leave the dough to one side until it is 50% bigger (about 4 hours in
    a warm place), then transfer to the fridge and leave to prove there for 8 –
    12 hours.
  - "Bake: The next morning preheat the oven to 220°C for at least 30 minutes before ready to bake. Place a baking stone in the oven and a large pan of boiling water underneath, or use a bowl with a lid and preheat the lid in the oven. The hydration helps to form the crust. Once heated, remove the baking stone or lid from the oven, and dust with a fine layer of flour. Place your dough onto the baking stone or lid, and slash the top a few times with a sharp knife. Cover with the bowl if using. Bake for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to 180°C and remove the bowl if using, and bake for another 10-15\_minutes to form a darker crust. Leave to cool completely before slicing, and if possible, leave for a day to let the full flavour develop."

ingredients:
  - 585g self-raising flour
  - 400g granulated sugar
  - 40g cornflour
  - 1½ tsp baking powder
  - ¾ tsp baking soda
  - ½ tsp salt
  - 750ml soya milk
  - 310ml vegetable oil
  - 5 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - 4 tsp vanilla extract
  - '## Filling'
  - 560g frozen or fresh mixed berries
  - 150g granulated sugar
  - 30ml lemon juice
  - '## Frosting'
  - 150g vegan butter
  - 50g coconut oil
  - '400g icing sugar, sifted'
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - '## Garnish'
  - Fresh berries
  - Fresh mint leaves
directions:
  - >-
    For the berry filling, add the frozen berries, sugar and lemon juice to a
    medium sized pan. Stir over medium heat until it starts to boil. Reduce the
    heat to low and allow the filling to simmer for 15-20 minutes, until
    thickened slightly. Remove from heat and pour the berry filling into a bowl.
    Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until completely chilled.
  - Preheat the oven to 180°C. Prepare three 20cm round cake pans.
  - >-
    In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, cornflour, baking powder,
    baking soda and salt.
  - >-
    In a measuring jug, whisk together the milk, oil, vinegar and vanilla
    extract.
  - >-
    Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until combined. Divide the batter
    evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 35 minutes, until a
    skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
  - >-
    Leave to cool for 10 minutes, then gently remove from the pans and leave to
    cool completely.
  - >-
    For the frosting, add the vegan butter and coconut oil to a medium bowl.
    Beat together until smooth, using mixer with balloon whisk. Add in the icing
    sugar a bit at a time and beat for 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and
    beat for another minute. The frosting should be smooth and pipeable but not
    so soft that it slumps.
  - >-
    To assemble the cake, spread about ⅙ of the frosting evenly over the first
    cake layer, then pipe a frosting dam along the edge to hold in the berry
    filling. Gently spread half the berry filling over the top of the frosting,
    taking care not to press in and lift any of the buttercream into the berry
    layer. Add the next cake layer and repeat until you have your 3 cake layers
    assembled with the berry layer and frosting. Smooth a thin layer of frosting
    on the top and around the sides of the cake.
  - >-
    Top with an assortment of fresh berries and mint leaves. The cake stores
    best in the fridge. Remove it from the fridge about 30 minutes before
    serving.

servings: servces 12
ingredients:
  - 375g self-raising flour
  - 125g caster sugar
  - 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - ½ tsp ground nutmeg
  - ½ tsp salt
  - 150g vegetable oil
  - >-
    2 tbsp unsweetened applesauce (or 1 large apple blended with a few tbsp
    water)
  - 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
  - 50ml oat milk
  - '375g apples, peeled and diced'
  - '115g chopped walnuts, almonds or pecans'
  - 15g granulated or brown sugar
  - ¾ tsp cinnamon
directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180°C and prepare a cake tin.

    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, caster sugar, bicarbonate of
    soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt.
  - >-
    In a measuring jug, combine the oil, applesauce, vanilla and milk. Add the
    wet mixture to the dry and stir until combined. The dough will be quite
    stiff - add a little more milk if needed, however the apples will provide a
    lot of moisture during baking.

    Fold in the diced apples and nuts. Pour the batter into the tin and spread
    evenly. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick
    inserted comes out clean.

servings: makes 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - 450g strong white or wholewheat bread flour
  - 2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast
  - 8g sea salt
  - ~450ml warm water
  - 2 tbsp seseame seeds
directions:
  - >-
    In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and salt. Add the water and mix until
    all the flour is incorporated. The dough should be wet and not kneadable.
    Adjust with more water or flour if needed.
  - >-
    Cover and leave to rest for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. It should be
    wobbly with bubbles on top. Perform a stretch and fold with at least 6
    folds. Leave to rest for another 2-4 hours. At this stage, you can either
    bake immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 days for flavour development.
  - >-
    When ready to bake, if refridgerated, remove the bowl from the fridge for an
    hour before baking. Preheat to 220°C, for 30 minutes prior to baking. Place
    lid of the baking dish or a baking tray in the oven to preheat.
  - >-
    Shape the dough by folding the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form
    a round shape.
  - >-
    Remove the lid or tray from the oven. Place the dough on the floured lid.
    Cut 3 or 4 slashes into the dough to allow the air to escape. Top with
    sesame seeds. Place the dish on top. Alternatively, place on a lined baking
    tray and pour water in a tray at the base of the oven to create steam. Bake
    1 hour covered, then 10 minutes uncovered at 180°C or until deep golden and
    crispy. Cool on wire rack before slicing.

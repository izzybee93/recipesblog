servings: serves 2
ingredients:
  - 1 cauliflower head
  - 4 tbsp olive oil
  - 2 tsp turmeric
  - Fresh cracked pepper
  - Sea salt
  - 500 ml vegetable stock
  - 'Handful of fresh coriander, chopped'
  - Juice of 1 lime
  - 1 tsp red chilli paste
  - 2 tsp maple syrup
directions:
  - >-
    Preheat the oven to 170Â°C. Remove the fibrous stems from outside of the
    cauliflower head, but leave the thinner leaves intact. Slice the head in
    half, and then slice each half in half again, resulting in two cauliflower
    steaks. (Save the outer halves for another recipe).
  - >-
    Cover a baking tray with 3 tbsp olive oil, turmeric, fresh cracked pepper,
    and salt, to taste. Take each cauliflower steak and roll them around on the
    tray until both sides are coated in the marinade. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a
    large pan, place the cauliflower steaks in the pan, and sear them until
    brown on each side.
  - >-
    Transfer to an oven safe dish. Pour vegetable stock into the dish, about 3cm
    in height. Transfer to the oven for 10-20 minutes.
  - >-
    Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette. In a bowl, whisk together the chopped
    cilantro (saving a few leaves for topping), lime juice, chilli paste, maple
    syrup, and sea salt to taste.
  - >-
    Remove the cauliflower steaks when soft and seem ready - there should still
    be a decent amount of vegetable stock in the pan when you remove it. Serve
    topped with the vinaigrette and fresh cilantro leaves.

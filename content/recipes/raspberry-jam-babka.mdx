servings: serves 10
ingredients:
  - 250g white bread flour
  - 125g plain flour
  - '165g oat milk, warm'
  - '110g vegan butter, room temperature'
  - 30g caster sugar
  - 7g instant dry yeast
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - ½ tsp ground nutmeg
  - Pinch of salt
  - 120g raspberry jam
directions:
  - >-
    Combine all the dough ingredients in a large bowl. Mix until all ingredients
    come together.
  - >-
    Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface  for 10-15 minutes. The dough
    is ready when it's soft and stretchy.
  - >-
    Place the dough in a bowl and cover with a damp tea towel. Leave to rest in
    a warm place for at least 1 hour or until doubled in size.
  - 'Shape: Line a 20cm loaf tin with baking paper.'
  - >-
    On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle shape
    around 25x20cm. The long side of the dough should be a little longer than
    the length of your loaf tin.
  - Spread the jam filling onto the dough leaving a 1cm border around the edge.
  - >-
    Starting from the long side, roll the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife to
    cut the log in half lengthways. Carefully twirl the two strips together,
    with the cut side facing up to show the layers.
  - >-
    Lift the dough into your loaf tin, slightly squashing it to the length of
    the tin. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside to rise for at least 1
    hour. The babka is ready when it rises by 20% and looks soft and puffy. If
    leaving to rest overnight, place in the fridge.
  - >-
    Bake: Remove from the fridge and bring it back to room temperature before
    baking, leaving to rest for 1-2 hours. Preheat your oven to 170°C.
  - "Bake for 35 minutes, until golden brown. If the top of is browning too quickly reduce the heat to\_150°C and cover with foil. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving. The babka is best eaten on the day it is baked. Alternatively, store it an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2 days. Warm up the leftovers before serving."

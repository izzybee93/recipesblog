servings: "serves 2-3"
ingredients:
  - 2 large sweet potatoes
  - 120g plain flour
  - 1 tsp sea salt
directions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C. Prepare a baking tray.
  - Prick the sweet potatoes in several places and bake for 45 mins until soft.
  - Once the sweet potatoes have cooled slightly, slice open and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Mash until smooth.
  - Mix the flour and salt together then create a small mountain and make a hole in the centre. Place the sweet potato mash in the centre and incorporate together to form a soft dough. Do not add too much flour.
  - Dust a surface with flour. Divide the dough evenly into four pieces. Roll each piece out into a 2.5cm thick log.
  - Cut the logs into 2.5cm long pieces. Push down with a fork on each piece to create a groove.
  - Bring a large pan of salted water to boil. Cook the gnocchi for a few minutes, until they rise to the surface.
  - Serve with your favourite pesto, veggies and a handful of rocket leaves.

    1. Before you make the risotto, heat oven to 180C. Toss the squash in 1 tbsp oil together with the chopped sage. Scatter into a shallow roasting tin and roast for 30 mins until it is brown and soft.

    2. While the squash is roasting, prepare the risotto. Heat the oil in a pan, add the onions and cook gently for 5 mins until soft but not coloured, followed by the the garlic, stirring occasionally. Stir the rice into the onions until completely coated, then stir continuously until the rice is shiny and the edges of the grain start to look transparent.

    3. Pour in the wine and simmer until completely evaporated. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stirring the rice over a low heat for 25-30 mins, until the rice is cooked al dente (with a slightly firm, starchy bite in the middle). The risotto should be creamy and slightly soupy.

    4. When the squash is cooked, mash half of it to a rough purée and leave half whole. When the risotto is just done, stir through the purée, and some whole chunks of squash. Serve the risotto scattered with the remaining whole chunks of squash and the crisp sage leaves.

    1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line loaf tin with parchment paper.
    2. If using dried cranberries, soak them in warm orange juice for 5-10 minutes. Drain the juice and set the cranberries aside.
    3. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
    4. In large bowl, cream together vegan butter, sugar and flax egg. Stir in the orange juice, 3/4 of the zest and cranberries.
    5. Add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into the loaf tin. 
    6. Bake for 1 hour, until lightly browned and the bread bounces back when lightly pressed. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack before icing.
    7. To make the icing, combine powdered sugar with lemon juice, adding a tablespoon at a time  until the consistency is liquid enough to drizzle on top. Drizzle the bread with icing and sprinkle the remaining orange zest on top.
